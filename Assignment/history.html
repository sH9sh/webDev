            <p>
                Westport originates and gets its name, in Irish, from a 16th-century castle
                - Cathair na Mart (meaning "the stone fort of the beeves" or "the city of the fairs")
                - and surrounding settlement, belonging to the powerful
                local seafaring Ó Máille clan, who controlled the Clew Bay area, then known as Umaill.
            </p> <br><br>
            <p>
                The original village of Cathair na Mart existed somewhere around what is now the front 
                (east) lawn of Westport House. It had a high street, alleys down to the river and a population 
                of around 700. A small port also existed at the mouth of the Carrowbeg river. Roads lead 
                from the village to the west (West Road), the south (Sandy Hill Road) and the east (Old Paddock 
                Road). The intention of John Browne, later the First Earl of Altamont to move the existing 
                Cahernamart settlement to facilitate the landscaping of parklands around Westport House was 
                outlined to Richard Pococke when he visited Browne in 1752.
            </p> <br><br>
            <p>
                Designed by the architects Richard Cassels, Thomas Ivory and James Wyatt in the 18th century, 
                Westport House is situated in a parkland setting with a lake, terraces, gardens and views overlooking 
                Clew Bay, the Atlantic Ocean, Achill, Clare Island and Ireland's Holy Mountain, Croagh Patrick.
